This folder has two small apps developed for interfacing with [Oandas](http://developer.oanda.com) REST API.
Specifically using Oandas V-20 REST API.


Oanda-first only has downloading historical data prices for 'EUR_USD' FOREX prices,
while Oanda-Event is an intro to an event driven software for streaming live prices from Oanda
as well building on what was learned from Oanda-first to begin data collection for backtesting.
Inspiration for the event driven software written in python comes from [Quant Start](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Forex-Trading-Diary-1-Automated-Forex-Trading-with-the-OANDA-API)
