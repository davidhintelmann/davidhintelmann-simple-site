Since this is a free GitHub account and I can only have one repository, python code is in folder labeled python.
Here are two attempts to begin understanding [Oandas](https://www.oanda.com) REST API.


A live tick stream has been developed based on [Quant Start](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Forex-Trading-Diary-1-Automated-Forex-Trading-with-the-OANDA-API) tutorial on an event driven software to control an automatted trading platform. WARNING FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.


This code will require folder called res in the directory parent to python folder.
The res folder will need to have ids.json file for ID and oanda_api_key.json file for API token issued by Oanda (create folder and json files).
